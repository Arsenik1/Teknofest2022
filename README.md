Here, you can access all the development codes I have used in Teknofest 2022 International UAV Rotary Wing Competition. It allowed my team to win the competition as 2nd place. "artikblue_otonom_aqua.py" file was the main code, it had been coded in the time when I was a freshman in GTU.

# Teknofest2022 International UAV Rotary Wing Competition Code

Welcome to the GitHub repository where you can find the development codes used in the Teknofest 2022 International UAV Rotary Wing Competition. Our team secured the 2nd place, and this repository hosts the code that contributed to this achievement.

## Main Code File

- `artikblue_otonom_aqua.py`: This is the main code file which was developed during my freshman year at GTU.
- When the program runs:
  1. The drone goes to specific coordinates while avoiding obstacles
  2. Sees the red area and saves it's coordinates
  3. Finishes the first round
  4. Goes for the second round
  5. Determines the place and centers the pool to get water
  6. Gets the water
  7. Goes to the previously determined red spot and pours the water
  8. Comes back around the obstacles to the starting place and lands to the ground.

## Competition Achievement

Our team was awarded the 2nd place in the competition, showcasing our technical skills and teamwork.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
  - NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
  - DroneKit: For giving mission to the drone from python code.
  
- **Hardware**:
  - UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle): We have built and utilized it for the rotary wing competition.
  - Sensors: Various sensors for real-time data collection and analysis used on drone with RaspBerry Pi.
